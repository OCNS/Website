                <p>I obtained my PhD in Physics in 2003 working on neural modeling working under Dr. Andre Longtin's supervision at the University of Ottawa. After a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Oklahoma, I joined the department of Physiology at McGill University in 2006 where I have held the Canada Research Chair in Neural Information Coding and am now an associate professor. The goal of my research is to understand how sensory information is represented across brain areas and, importantly, how this leads to perception and behavior. Towards this end, we employ a variety of techniques including mathematical modeling, signal processing, in vitro as well as in vivo electrophysiology, and behavior. Our animal models include both lower vertebrates such as weakly electric fish as well as non-human primates. </p>

Since 2013, I have been a postdoc in the lab of Prof. Angus Silver at UCL, London.
,During my PhD, I have worked with deterministic and stochastic conductance-based models to address the interplay of chaos and noise in shaping single cell dynamics. I then joined the SilverLab to study synaptic integration in biophysically accurate network models. My current work also focusses on initiatives promoting greater reusability and reproducibility for computational models, such as the NeuroML/LEMS languages and the OpenSourceBrain Project, as well as 3d microscopy.</p>

                <p><strong>Motivation:</strong>&nbsp;I would like to contribute to the Computational Neuroscience community via the OCNS, with the view to emphasize theoretical and computational work that makes sense of experimental neuroscience data, and increase our visibility within the Neuroscience community. Ideally, I would like to encourage sessions that highlight joint work between experimentalists and computational scientists or theorists.</p>

                <p>Pierre Yger is a young INSERM Researcher, working currently in the group of Dr. Romain Brette in Paris. After a PhD under the supervision of Dr. Yves Fregnac in computational neuroscience, focusing on plasticity in large-scale neuronal networks of spiking neurons, especially in the V1 area, he did a postdoc in London under the supervision of Dr. Kenneth Harris, and a collaboration in Janelia Farm with Karel Svoboda. His research topics are focused on synaptic plasticity and neuronal dynamics in primary sensory areas. He has published over 15 peer-reviewed articles in major journals (including several J. Neuro, PloS Comp Biol). His key position as an interdisciplinary scientist makes him the ideal candidate the OCNS position.</p>

                <p><strong>Motivation:</strong>&nbsp;Applying as a director of the OCNS is a great opportunity to be part of the organization of such a conference, and it will be a unique opportunity, to be at the center of my scientific community. As a young PI, I could bring a fresh view on how everything should be handled during the conference in order to guarantee its success. I regularly attended the conference, as I think that interdisciplinary research such as computational neuroscience will become more and more relevant in a near future.</p>
                <p><strong>OCNS and CNS participation:</strong> attended more than 5 CNS meeting(s). OCNS member since 2007.</p>
                <p><strong>Other information:</strong>&nbsp;Pierre Yger organized a plasticity workshop, in Praha, during OCNS 2015. As an interdisciplinary scientist, he also contributed to several tools for data analysis and simulation widely shared among the community (PyNN, Neo, Brian). He also worked as a tutor for the Okinawa summer school.</p>
