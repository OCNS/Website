In 2013, I received the Bernstein Award that funds my own group jointly based at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies and the Ernst Strngmann Institute for Neuroscience. My particular expertise is on morphological models of dendritic trees and I am the main developer of the TREES toolbox, a free open source software package with hundreds of active users.

It is an interdisciplinary lab, which bridges computational and experimental neuroscience and gives a good perspective on the importance of the interaction of the two approaches. I am interested in synaptic plasticity, specifically on the role of calcium and neuromodulation and how both calcium and neuromodulation govern interactions of signaling pathways underlying functional and structural plasticity.</p>

                <p>During a self-funded post-doc in Indiana University, I have been fascinated with the complexity of the neuronal networks and the way which our intelligence emerges from the complex organism. In the term, I also visited many European nations. After staying for a short while at Massattsets General Hospital as a visiting scholar, I started as Assistant Professor in Osaka University. I received PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Tokyo in 2009. The recent scientific targets are Computational Anatomy in both macroscopic and microscopic levels, as well as multi-scale computational modelings based on experimental data. Including the present projects, I have acquired various experimental data, such as Multi-electrode array, Ca Imaging, fMRI, DTI, EEG-TMS, and MEG. </p>

I have gradually realized through teaching that I have become of the age to support the curiosity of younger generations coming up in the field, and as a natural outcome, hope to continue to contribute for the growth of the community in an international team.</p>

Currently, several projects are progressing based on international collaborations and on collaborations with clinical doctors.</p>

                <p><strong>Motivation:</strong>&nbsp;
,OCNS provides a fantastic place for people from all around the world to discuss about basic science, related to computational neuroscience. I believe its emphasis on theory and modeling is important and unique. I would like to promote computational neuroscience further and, for this, I believe that it is important to reach out to even wider geographic communities.

                <p>Following undergraduate studies in Prague, I obtained a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1996. During a postdoctoral fellowship at Rockefeller University in 1999-2002, I got converted from a ?pure" physicist into a biophysicist studying neural systems. In 2002-2008, I headed a small research group at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, in Dresden. Since my return to Prague in 2008, I have worked as senior scientist and deputy head at the Department of Computational Neuroscience, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences. In recent years, my research has focused mainly on two areas: biophysical mechanisms in neural development, and neuro-mechanical interactions in motor control. </p>

I would now like to use this experience to help the future local organizers in their work and to help define the most productive format of future CNS Meetings. I also wish to encourage an expansion of the role of OCNS beyond the yearly meeting.</p>
