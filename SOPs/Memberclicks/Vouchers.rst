Creating vouchers
==================

Step 1: Edit the related form
------------------------------

#. Navigate to "Forms" > "Form List".
#. Click "Edit" link next to the required form form in the list (CNS 2019, for
   example).
#. Click "Pricing" > "Discount codes" > "Edit the discount codes for this form" to manage vouchers related to this form.

Step 2: Create the new voucher
-------------------------------

#. Click "Add a discount code".
#. Select the " The discount code will cause the form to use an alternate pricing scheme for fields" option.
#. Enter a name for the voucher. Generally, it is of the form:
   :code:`YEAR_REASON_RANDOM`. For example, `2034_CONF_REG_asdfbg`. The random
   letters at the end are added for security reasons.
#. Ensure that the status is currently set to "Inactive">
#. Update the "End date" to the ending date of the conference.

Step 3: Edit prices
--------------------

#. Click the "edit" link to edit prices for various registration groups.
#. For a group that receives a full waiver, for example, all registration
   related prices would be set to 0.00. (Waivers are generally not provided for
   add ons such as Banquet tickets and T-shirts)
#. Verify each price list again to confirm they are correct.

Step 4: Activate voucher and disseminate to required people
------------------------------------------------------------

#. When the prices have been verified as correct, switch the status of the
   voucher to "Active".
#. Provide the voucher code to the Board member in-charge of providing them to
   attendees.
