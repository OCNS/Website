Registration cancellations
###########################
:summary: This documents how registration cancellations are handled on Memberclicks.
:resource: Memberclicks
:roles involved: treasurer, program chair

- A request for cancellation of registration is received.
- These requests must be forwarded to the ONCS treasurer.
- The treasurer issues the refund.
- The treasurer deletes the registration record from the list in the
  registration form. This moves the receipt from the "Inbox" folder to the
  "Deleted Receipts" folder. Please note that the record can only be deleted
  when the transaction is complete.
- The treasurer notifies the user that made the request. The treasurer CCs the
  program chair to this notification to check if abstracts need to be removed
  or transferred to co-authors as a result.
