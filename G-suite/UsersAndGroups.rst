Users and groups
-----------------

The G-suite enables OCNS to set up different user and group accounts for
management and collaboration between the Board and members.

The users set up for different Board members each have separate mailboxes
ensuring that all communication is safely archived. In most cases, these are
also setup to forward the received e-mails to associated groups to ensure that
all users involved in the particular role receive e-mails.
